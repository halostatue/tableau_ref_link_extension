Security reports are accepted for the most recent major release with support for
the previous major version ending immediately.

TableauRefLinkExtension supports at most the three most recent versions of
Elixir and supported [Erlang/OTP versions][otp-versions].

As of January 2026, the support list is:

| Elixir | Erlang         |
| ------ | -------------- |
| 1.18   | 25, 26, 27, 28 |
| 1.19   | 26, 27, 28     |

The oldest supported version of Elixir will not be deprecated until six months
after the release of a new version of Elixir.
